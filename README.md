# week-1-homework
For this week's Challenge, my task is to make thw web page accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

## Follow the following criteria 

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards

1. WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<article>
<nav> 

2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
I labelled different elements and selectors for other people to read more easily

3. WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes 
added short description for  alt attribute

4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
I organized the codes accroding to the standards

5. WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
I gave a unique name to the webpage
